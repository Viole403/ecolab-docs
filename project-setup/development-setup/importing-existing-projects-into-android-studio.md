**Handling Dialog Boxes:**

During project import, Android Studio might display a dialog box. If it appears, simply click "OK" to proceed.

**Troubleshooting Gradle Build Issues:**

In certain scenarios, the Gradle build process might encounter errors. Android Studio may prompt you to download additional SDK components in the "Messages" tab. Follow the on-screen instructions to install these components and resolve the build issues.

**Additional Notes:**

* This guide assumes a basic understanding of file management and navigating directories.
* Downloading from Git offers version control benefits, allowing you to track project changes and collaborate more effectively.
* Refer to the official Android Studio documentation for further assistance with project import or troubleshooting: [https://developer.android.com/develop](https://developer.android.com/develop).

By following these steps, you can successfully import existing projects from GitHub into Android Studio and begin your development journey.
