# System Requirements

## System Requirements

Ready to build Ecolab with Flutter? Before you dive in, let's make sure your computer is prepped for the adventure! Here's a quick rundown of what you'll need depending on your operating system:**Windows Users:**

* **OS:** Think Windows 8 (64-bit) or something newer? You're good to go!
* **RAM:** Aim for at least 8GB, but 16GB is the real MVP for smooth sailing.
* **CPU:** Think 2nd generation Intel Core or a newer AMD CPU that's got Windows Hypervisor Framework on its side.
* **Disk Space:** 8GB minimum for Android Studio, the Android SDK, and the emulator (think of it as your app testing playground).
* **Screen Resolution:** 1280 x 800 or higher - enough space to see your creations come to life!

**Mac Users:**

* **OS:** Got a Mac rocking macOS 10.14 (Mojave) or later? Perfect!
* **RAM:** Same as Windows folks, 8GB minimum, 16GB recommended.
* **CPU:** Apple M1 chip or a 2nd generation Intel Core (or newer) with Hypervisor Framework support is what you need.
* **Disk Space:** Same as Windows - 8GB minimum for all the necessary tools.
* **Screen Resolution:** 1280 x 800 or higher for a clear view of your app-building journey.

**Linux Users:**

* **OS:** Any 64-bit Linux distribution that supports Gnome, KDE, or Unity DE (Desktop Environments) is welcome! Plus, you'll need GNU C Library (glibc) 2.31 or later.
* **RAM:** Here's the familiar refrain: 8GB minimum, 16GB recommended for a smoother experience.
* **CPU:** x86\_64 architecture with a 2nd generation Intel Core or newer AMD processor with support for AMD Virtualization (AMD-V) and SSSE3.
* **Disk Space:** Same as the others - 8GB minimum for all the goodies.
* **Screen Resolution:** 1280 x 800 or higher to see your code shine.
